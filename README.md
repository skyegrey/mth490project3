Question 1
Between the three analysis, the basic linear regression in part a seems to be the best estimator (though by a very
small margin) despite the selection of lambda. Note, with lambda equal to 10**6, the gradient descent function explodes

Question 2
A lower value of k seems appropriate for k-NN. We used k=3.
